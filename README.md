# Async::HTTP::Faraday

Provides an adaptor for [Faraday] to perform async HTTP requests. If you are designing a new library, you should probably just use `Async::HTTP::Client` directly.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'async-http-faraday'
```

And then execute:

	$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$ gem install async-http-faraday

## Usage

Here is how you set faraday to use `Async::HTTP`:

```ruby
require 'async/http/faraday'

# Make it the global default:
Faraday.default_adapter = :async_http

# Per connection:
conn = Faraday.new(...) do |faraday|
	faraday.adapter :async_http
end
```

Here is how you make a request:

```ruby
Async do
	response = conn.get("/index")
end
```

### Default

To make this the default adaptor:

```ruby
require 'async/http/faraday/default'
```
